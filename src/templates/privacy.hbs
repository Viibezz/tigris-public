		<h1 class="mb-4">Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 14, 2025</p>

		<p>
			At {{company}}, we value your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when
			you visit our website
			(<a href="https://tigrisgrille.com" target="_blank">https://tigrisgrille.com</a>). By using our site, you agree to
			the terms outlined below.
		</p>

		<p><strong class="mt-5">1. What Information Do We Collect?</strong></p>
		<p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect any personal information directly from you. We do not require you to create an
			account, submit personal data, or make purchases on our site.</p>
		<p>However, third-party services we link to—such as <strong>DoorDash, Uber Eats, Grubhub, and Clover</strong>—may
			collect information when you interact with their services.</p>

		<p><strong class="mt-5">2. Do We Use Cookies or Tracking Technologies?</strong></p>
		<p>We may use basic cookies or tracking technologies (e.g., Google Analytics) to ensure our website functions properly
			and to improve user experience.</p>
		<p>We do <strong>not</strong> use cookies for advertising or sell your data. You can disable cookies in your browser
			settings if preferred.</p>
		<p>To opt out of Google Analytics tracking, visit:
			<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>
		</p>

		<p><strong class="mt-5">3. Third-Party Services</strong></p>
		<p>We link to trusted third-party platforms for online ordering and payments:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>DoorDash</li>
			<li>Uber Eats</li>
			<li>Grubhub</li>
			<li>Clover</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These services may collect personal information and use cookies. Please review the terms of service and privacy policies of these third-party platforms directly before using their platforms, as they govern your use of their services and their handling of your personal information.</p>
		<p><strong>We are not responsible</strong> for the privacy practices of third-party services.</p>

		<p><strong class="mt-5">4. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</strong></p>
		<p>While we do not collect personal data directly, we take reasonable steps to secure our website. However, no
			internet-based system is 100% secure.</p>

		<p><strong class="mt-5">5. Your Privacy Rights (U.S. Residents)</strong></p>
		<p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell or share your personal data.</p>
		<p>If you are a resident of a U.S. state with data privacy laws, you may have rights such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The right to know what personal data is collected (we don't collect any)</li>
			<li>The right to opt out of targeted advertising (we don't use it)</li>
			<li>The right to request deletion of personal data (not applicable)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To make a privacy-related request, contact us at:
			<a href="mailto:i{{email}}">{{email}}</a>
		</p>

		<p><strong class="mt-5">6. Do Not Track (DNT) Signals</strong></p>
		<p>Some browsers offer a “Do Not Track” feature. We currently do not respond to DNT signals due to lack of a universal
			standard. We may update this if that changes.</p>

		<p><strong class="mt-5">7. Changes to This Policy</strong></p>
		<p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. When we do, we'll revise the “Last updated” date at the top. Major
			changes may be noted on our homepage.</p>
