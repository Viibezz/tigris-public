            throughout the nation. From time to time I like to eat at other Mediterranean restaurants to see what
            other similar in the industry are cooking up.
            <br>The rice is perfect, the dill dressing that compliments it is perfect. The hummus is perfect, the
            taboli is perfect.
            <br>
            <br>The best part the kebab is made PERFECT! You can tell all the ingredients are high quality and well
            worth it for the price you pay.
            <br>I got 3 meats to try and all of them were cooked to perfect temperature and seasoned just right
            <br>1. The beef kebab
            <br>2. The chicken tikka

The person at the counter was so welcoming and even encouraged us to customize our order. I ended up getting the chicken shawarma with a Greek salad, and my husband got the gyro fries. The freshness of the ingredients was amazing, the meat was perfectly juicy and flavorful. We left with full bellies and big smiles and will absolutely be returning soon! Do yourself a favor and try them out! We highly recommend!!"

Delicious flavors, and the portion sizes are so generous - almost as generous as Fadi, who was so kind and welcoming :) Fadi checked in on us multiple times, gave us baklava, and clearly puts a lot of care into his work and Tigris. Thank you so much! Can't wait to come back!"

            today I figured I'd tried it out. The catering was great but the hot and fresh food was even better. I
            ordered the falafel plate and after tip it came to $23, which I thought was steep. After being served
            and seeing the portions, $23 was a steal! I was only able to eat about a third for lunch and saved the
            left overs for later. Overall, 10/10 great food for a great price."

            empty. After eating their food, I'm surprised they don't have more business! The restaurant had plenty
            of seating and was pretty clean so my friends and I got seated quickly as well. I originally ordered a
            ground beef kebab plate but I was very indecisive between that and the ground chicken kebab. The cashier
            then offered to give me one of each, which I greatly appreciated! The cashier brought out my friends and
            I's food out when it was ready and I was surprised by the quantity of food they served. The kebabs were
            served on a fluffy bed of saffron rice, a refreshing tabbouleh salad, and a smooth, garlicky hummus
            paired with a warm pita to dip it in. The kebabs were freshly grilled and had a savory, meaty flavor to
            them that you would expect from a kebab. If you're looking for great mediterranean food that gives you
            bang for buck, I highly recommend Tigris!"
